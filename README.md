*Full-Wave Design of Coaxial to Waveguide Transitions and Waveguide Mode Transducers*.

The purpose of this work was to provide an approach to design, simulate, optimize and analyze several coaxial to waveguide transitions with diﬀerent output modes and waveguide mode transducers (both rectangular and circular types).

A progressive approach through different mode transducers is made with the ultimate goal of the complete design and verification process: design, simulation, optimization, manufacturing and measuring of a Marié-type TE01 circular waveguide mode transducer. 

The aforementioned Full-Wave Design of Coaxial to Waveguide Transitions and Waveguide Mode Transducers process includes the manufacturing done by the additive manufacturing technique and the measurement by using the back-to-back technique allowing a suitable measurement of the insertion loss of the connection of two similar devices and besides, a good estimation of the return loss level. In order to verify the irrelevant influence of the other propagating modes four diﬀerent connection angles, 0, 45, 90 and 180 degrees between the two devices will be arranged in the measurements.
